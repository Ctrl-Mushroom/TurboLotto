# TurboLotto
A lottery game which you can adjust the game settings through codes and start playing with your friends!

  - Brief History: This mini-game is coded freshly at Turbo C when I was (=￣ω￣=).
  - Players has a power to adjust the maximum chosen set of numbers starting to one (through code).
  - Players may also adjust the range of possible numbers as long as the winning numbers still fits in your screen (through code).
  - Chosen set of numbers and winning numbers can be duplicated on this game and that makes the difference and thrill to the normal lottery game.
